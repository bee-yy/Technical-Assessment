# Pixelay Comparison Notes

- Minor spacing and alignment differences are visible in some sections, particularly where responsive adjustments were required and certain design details were not consistent across screen sizes in the Figma file.
- With more time, I would review the design in detail, ask the designer questions in unclear areas, and refine spacing, alignment, and visual consistency to make everything match perfectly.
