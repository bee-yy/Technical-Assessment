## Notes / Tradeoffs

- Some spacing, alignment, and small design details were slightly different from the Figma design.
- With more time, I would spend more time reviewing the design in detail, ask the designer questions in unclear areas, and refine spacing, alignment, and visual consistency to make everything match perfectly.
- 2 sections were not built fully due to time constraints, such as the enhanced plan section that is only on the mobile view.
